////Files description////
S1. Predict.R; load real dataset. predict average PM10 time series and average mortality time series
S2. Set PM10 effects.R; specify hypothetical lag-structures of PM10 effects.
S3. Simulation Run(DLM0730).R; simulate distributed lag models (lag0â€“730) to estimate specified PM10 effects, with different adjustment methods for seasonality and time-trend
S4. Simulation Run(MA01).R; simulate two-day moving average models to estimate specified PM10 effects, with different adjustment methods for seasonality and time-trend
S5. Simulation Figure in Main Text. Get Table 2 and Figure 3 in the main text.
